<p align="justify"><font size="5">The country is home to more than 100 waterfalls and rivers which at the end of the day stops at the Indian Ocean. Waterfalls are mostly located in the Hill Country. Some of the waterfalls are man-made but still doesn't stop short of being breath-takingly beautiful. Unknown waterfalls are still present, those that weren't officially discovered. Most of the waterfalls are very difficult to find because of the dense forests and are sometimes totally inaccessible. Only a handfull of waterfalls are used to bathe in, whereas the others are too dangerous to do so.You can get some more information from <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g293961-Activities-c57-t95-Sri_Lanka.html">here</a>.</font></p>
